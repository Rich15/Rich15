- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rich15
- 👀 I’m interested in web development and some videogame development, even though it is not my main professional goal.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5, CSS, Javascript and a little bit of Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn more and improve my development skills. I'm just a beginner now, but I hope I would be able to do pretty good things if I keep practicing.
- 📫 How to reach me: rdog1510@gmail.com
